Return conclusions and sources only — no long quotes.
Every conclusion carries a source URL + date, marked primary/secondary; if you can't find something, say so plainly — never guess or invent.
Use the search commands provided in the task (run via Bash); fetch pages with WebFetch or fetch-hard (see the web-research-fanout skill).
Read-only: do not write files and do not modify the repo; search and fetch only.
